# SETI WOW signal - 15-Aug-1977

Here is my Java code to create a day's worth of data - 1 data line every 12 seconds - to simulate / try to recreate the SETI WOW Signal that was recorded on 15-Aug-1977.


## How did I "re-create" the data ?

I looked at all available screen shots for the data - the ones where Jerry Ehman had written "Wow!" on them - read articles to understand what the columns of data meant, and then I worked out the approximate frequencies for various characters as best as I could, and then wrote a program to generate the data with that same approximate pattern, and then insert the SETI WOW signal into this data.


## Why did I write software to try and recreate the SETI WOW signal data ?

Two Reasons:

### Answer #1: For Fun !
Have often wished I had access to NASA's data.  I have found NASA's web site where dozens (100's) of mouth watering data sets are listed - stuff I'd love to analyze - but there is no download button.  I would love to have access to SETI type data to analyse for fun.  I don't mean SETI @ Home - my home computers ran this for several months many years ago.  SETI @ HOME was fun, but the volume of data is never ending.  I want to WRITE the software myself to try and find patterns, interesting stuff in a maneageable set of data.  Idealy, I'd like access to the data from a bunch of tapes in old tape datasets.  e.g. the Moon Dust tapes found in 2008:

See: Lost Apollo moon dust tapes found in Australia, 10 Nov 2008, https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240087424/Lost-Apollo-moon-dust-tapes-found-in-Australia


### Answer #2: for my students !
I hoped this SETI WOW data set would be interesting / fun / engaging for my students to analyze.  They could write a simple program to try and find anomalies in the data, like the SETI WOW Signal.

## What is the SETI WOW signal ?

The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, "6EQUJ5", and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.[2]

The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, despite several subsequent attempts by Ehman and others. Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explains the signal.[3]

Although the Wow! signal had no detectable modulation—a technique used to transmit information over radio waves—it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.[3]
